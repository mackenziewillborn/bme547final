# BME547 Final Project - Image Processing Server
## Mackenzie Willborn, Kelsey Li, Connor Johnson

This repository hosts the code for our final project. We have created a database hosting user information, raw images, processed images, and image metadata. Using our user-friendly GUI, information is sent through the server to be posted on the database and retreived for use later on.

Our server is deployed on the following virtual machine:

By running the im_process_GUI.py program, you can enter your username and raw files you would like to be processed. You can then pick your preffered processing type. After posting this information to the database, our program will return to you the time uploaded, total processing time, and image size.
